The client in question, The Gaming Room, has a game titled Draw It or Lose It on the android. The client wishes to not only improve the system's functionality, but to also expand their game to other platforms. 

What I did particularly well in developing the documentation was creating a UML class diagram of the system and breaking it down on how each class was related to one another for the game's function.

The design document has done a good job on keeping me on task and figuring out what are the next steps that are needed to be taken when it comes to developing the code.

If I could revise one part of my work on the documents to revise, I would choose the evaluation for each 
platform because there may be some information on each platform to the server side, client side, and development tools that I may have missed or forgotten. The way I can improve on this revision is to further research each platform on those three factors.

I interpreted the user's needs by keeping every little detail that the client had in mind as to how they want to see the project carried out. It is important to consider the user's needs when it comes down to designing because the user has a vision in how they want to see their product perform in a certain way. That user's vision helps provide the developers a blueprint and allow the developers to set tasks as to when a certain task shall be completed before moving on to the next task.

The way I approach designing the software is by describing the software in the clearest way possible and focus on what the game needs in terms of functionality. A strategy I would suggest in using for future projects is by developing a pseudocode. Using a pseudocode can act as a simulation prior to developing a code for real. Another thing I recommend is absorbing feedback from consumers so that you have a clear cut idea of what to do for fixing the product and future software developing to avoid making the same mistakes.
